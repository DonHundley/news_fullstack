Inspiration for the Box Factory featuring:
- A Github Actions workflow with dependency installation, build, execution and testing
- Tests of core features using all types we've been working with (E2E with Playwright & API tests using HttpClient)
- An Angular frontend for the API (in a minimalistic fashion) (found in api/frontend/ directory in the repo)
- A .NET Web API resemblant of what you've already built
